# Statim
A browser extension that makes the first claim of the patent static in patents.google.com


This extension is for easing the process of reading a patent. While reading a patent, we usually find the descriptions very lengthy and we keep on scrolling down. We have to even scroll all the way up for referring back to the claims. The extension here makes the first claim static on the right side of your screen. It helps one to keep a track of understanding of claims while diving deep into the descriptions.
